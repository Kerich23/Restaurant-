### A Restaurantâ€™s Food Delivery Database System Description

Technology has had a significant impact on the way organizations work, and one of the industries most affected is the food industry. Businesses can now provide meal delivery services to their consumers through the development of restaurant food delivery systems.

Using a restaurant food delivery system offers several advantages over the manual system of customers visiting restaurants and queuing for long periods. The food delivery system has made it easier for customers to access food from a variety of different menus online, providing an opportunity to sample a diverse range of foods not available in their local restaurants. Additionally, this system assists restaurants in lowering their operating costs by reducing the required staff.

### Database Model Design

As a restaurant operating a food delivery system, a simple yet efficient database system is necessary to manage day-to-day services. The following pieces of data need to be stored for day-to-day business operations and future referencing:

1. **Customer**: The name, contacts, and address of each customer with whom the restaurant interacts.
2. **Crew**: A list of crew information detailing their respective roles.
3. **Menu**: A comprehensive list of all menus offered by the restaurant, including the food items and the categories they belong to.
4. **Order Details**: An accurate record of every order and purchase, specifying the food name, menu category, food prices, purchase addresses, and order details.
5. **Delivery**: An accurate list of all deliveries made, including their order dates, customer information, and delivery addresses.
6. **Payment**: A detailed record to store payment details, including customer IDs and order IDs.

## Project Overview

### Database Model

The database model, created using Wondershare EdrawMax for UML diagrams, includes tables for customers, crew, menus, orders, deliveries, and payments, with clear relationships between them.

### SQL Queries

The project showcases various SQL queries for MS SQL Server, including data manipulation, data retrieval, aggregation, joins, views, and more.

### Specific Examples

Numerous examples demonstrate how to use SQL queries for different purposes, such as adding customers, updating order status, calculating total sales, or finding orders by date.
